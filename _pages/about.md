Yang Meng is pursuing a Statistics Ph.D. at the University of California, Irvine, expected to complete by 2026, under the mentorship of [Dr. Babak Shahbaba](https://ics.uci.edu/~babaks/) and [Dr. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). With three years of full-time professional experience in Data Science, he brings a wealth of practical knowledge to his academic pursuits. Prior to his doctoral studies, Yang earned his M.A. in Statistics from Columbia University in 2020, advised by [Dr. Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/), following his B.S. in Statistics from Zhejiang University in 2018.

Research Interests
======
His research focuses on four key areas within artificial intelligence: **Multimodal Learning**, where I explore multi-source image generation and multi-view variational autoencoders; **Generative Models**, particularly diffusion models, diffusion-VAE hybrids, and video generation techniques; **AI for Science**, applying AI to neuroscience, specifically through FMRI studies and hippocampal neuron activities, and to climate analysis; and **Uncertainty Quantification**, employing Bayesian neural networks and modern statistical inference to address uncertainties in AI models.
