I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine, expected to complete by 2026, co-advised by [Dr. Babak Shahbaba](https://ics.uci.edu/~babaks/) and [Dr. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). With three years of full-time professional experience in Data Science, I bring a wealth of practical knowledge to my academic pursuits. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a M.A. in Statistics from Columbia University in 2020, advised by [Dr. Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/), following a B.S. in Statistics from Zhejiang University in 2018.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on artificial intelligence: **Multimodal Learning**, where I explore multi-input image generation, latent representation analysis, and multimodal variational autoencoders; **Generative Models**, particularly diffusion models, diffusion-VAE hybrids, and video generation; **AI for Science**, applying AI to neuroscience, specifically through FMRI studies and hippocampal neuron activities, and to climate analysis; and **Uncertainty Quantification**, employing Bayesian neural networks and modern statistical inference to address uncertainties in AI models.
