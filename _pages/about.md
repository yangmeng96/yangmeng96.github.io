Yang Meng is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine, expected to complete by 2026, co-advised by [Dr. Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/) and [Dr. Babak Shahbaba](https://ics.uci.edu/~babaks/). With three years of full-time professional experience in Data Science, he brings a wealth of practical knowledge to his academic pursuits. Prior to his doctoral studies, Yang earned his M.A. in Statistics from Columbia University in 2020, advised by [Dr. Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/), following his B.S. in Statistics from Zhejiang University in 2018.

Research Interests
======
His research focuses on artificial intelligence, supported by [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).

**Multimodal Learning**: latent representation analysis, multimodal variational autoencoders, interpretable machine learning

**Generative Models**: particularly flow matching models, diffusion-VAE hybrids, normalizing flows, and protein language generation models

**AI for Science**: applying AI to single-cell biology, neuroscience, and public health

**Uncertainty Quantification**: employing Bayesian neural networks and modern statistical inference to address uncertainties in AI models.
