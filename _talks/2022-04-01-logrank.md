* Innovated a sample testing method reached from weighted log-rank statistics, and the power is ~12% higher than the other well-known methods in complicated mixture distributed datasets
* Applied the method to social network analysis and genetic variation samples, and the p-values are smaller and more stable compared to the other algorithms including minimum spanning tree and edge counting approaches
